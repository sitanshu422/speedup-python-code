Speed up Python code to C like performance

# WHAT IS NUMBA?
 Numba is a open source JIT compiler that translates
 a subset of python and numpy code into fast machine code
* Numba translates Python function to optimized machine code 
at run time  . Numba compile numerical algorithm in Python can approach the speed of
C or FROTRAN.
# WHAT IS JIT?
* JIT- just in time compilation
* It is the way of execution of code that involves in 
compilation during execution of a program rather than 
before execution
# 
* Without JIT-
  Execution time 11.85s
* With JIT-
   Execution time 0.81s
* SPEEDUP +4,232%
